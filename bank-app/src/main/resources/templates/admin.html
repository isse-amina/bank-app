        </p>
        <h5>Users</h5>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>All users must have the following properties: first name, last name, email, password and role.</li>
                <li>Once a user has been added to the database, they will also have an ID associated with them.</li>
                <li>A user can have one of two roles: user or admin.</li>
                <li>A user with type “user” can be created in the register page, but they will not have access to the admin section of the website.</li>
                <li>A user with type “admin” can only be created by another admin, but they will not have access to the user section of the website.</li>
                <li>If a user’s role is changed from “user” to “admin”, then all accounts and transactions associated with said user will be deleted, because admin’s do not have accounts.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Accounts</h5>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>All accounts must have the following properties: name, type, number, balance and owner.</li>
                <li>Once an account has been added to the database, it will also have an ID associated with it.</li>
                <li>User's must contact the bank to open an account.</li>
                <li>An account can be one of two types: account or credit card.</li>
                <li>The number associated with an account of type “account” must consist of 7 digits.</li>
                <li>The number associated with an account of type “credit card” must consist of 12 digits.</li>
                <li>The account owner must be a user with the role “user”.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Transactions</h5>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>All transactions must have the following properties: date, from account, to account and amount.</li>
                <li>Once a transaction has been added to the database, it will also have an ID associated with it.</li>
                <li>Currently, transactions refer to transfers between accounts belonging to the same user.</li>
                <li>The date of a transaction cannot be in the future.</li>
                <li>Transferring money to an account of type “credit card” reduces the balance of the account, because the user is paying off a debt.</li>
                <li>The “from account” cannot be of type “credit card”.</li>
                <li>The transaction amount cannot exceed the balance of the “from account”.</li>
            </ul>
